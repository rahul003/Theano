Migrate the GPU code-generators to the PyCUDA style, and eventually to OpenCL.
This means mainly to use a different kind of code-generation strategy.  The
kernel itself is compiled, but the calling code remains in python or cython.  We
would no longer generate entire C files this way, and no longer use the CLinker
for GPU code.
